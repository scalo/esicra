<h1>JSP Forms for Business Components</h1>
<p>The BC4J JSP wizards you used to generate this page help you create forms to 
  browse, query, or edit rowset data through view objects usages that your BC4J 
  JSP projects define. Each of these data access forms consists of one or more 
  JSP pages built using JDeveloper-provided JSP component tags from the BC4J Data 
  Tags custom tag library.</p>
<p>These topics help you to understand and work with the BC4J JSP forms:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#contents">Contents Organization</a></li>
  <li><a href="#browseform">Browse Form Usage</a></li>
  <li><a href="#editform">Edit Form Usage</a></li>
  <li><a href="#queryform">Query Form Usage</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="contents"></a>Contents Organization</h2>
<p>The <strong>Content</strong> frame of <code>main.html</code> displays your 
  BC4J JSP project's forms organized by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>View object usage which are specific to a view object instance. The default 
    title may look like <code>DeptView1</code>, where the number indicates a specific 
    usage of a view object since you may have more than one usage of the same 
    view object.</li>
  <li>View link usage which define a link between instances of master-detail related 
    view objects. The default title may look like <code>FkDeptnoLink</code>, where 
    <code>Fk</code> stands for the foreign-key, used to create the link.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether or not you see both categories in <b>Contents</b> depends upon the 
  selections you made in the BC4J JSP wizards and the data model that your Business 
  Components project defines. For example, if your Business Components project 
  did not define a master-detail link, you would not have been able to generate 
  a view link usage and consequently, there would be no category for view links 
  in <b>Contents</b>.</p>
<p>Within the above categories, you will have links to one or more individual 
  form types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Browse</strong> to navigate records in a predefined range specified 
    by the view object</li>
  <li><strong>Query</strong> to retrieve rows by creating a view criteria using 
    specific attributes of the view object</li>
  <li><strong>Edit</strong> to edit individual rows on the view object (this form 
    is not visible in Contents since you must click Browse to view the edit form)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Try this:</h3>
<p>Mouse over the <strong>Contents</strong> frame links. If your BC4J JSP project 
  was created with the Jakarta Project's Struts framework, your browser will display 
  a <code>.do</code> link instead of a <code>.jsp</code> link. In a Struts-based 
  JSP project, actions define the page forward, rather than a page link.</p>
<h2><a name="browseform"></a>Browse Form Usage</h2>
<p>Use this form to navigate records in a predefined range specified by the view 
  object usage. The browse form uses these JSP component tags from the BC4J Data 
  Tags custom tag library to navigate the rowset:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DataScroller component to provide these navigation functions:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Previous</strong> to navigate to the previous rows in the range</li>
    <li>Choose the current range and view available ranges selection using the 
      <code>oracle.jbo.html.jsp.datatags.DataScroller</code> web bean</li>
    <li><strong>Next</strong> to navigate to the next rows in the range</li>
  </ul>
  <li>DataTable component tag to display the attributes of the view object usage 
    in the current range and to provide links to delete or edit individual rows 
    (if you created a form to browse and edit)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Try this:</h3>
<p>Mouse over the <strong>Previous</strong> link and view the link definition 
  in your browser. The DataScroller component tag passes request parameters on 
  the URL to the target JSP. In this case, BCJ4 JSP pages define themselves as 
  the target by default. The request parameters are specific to BC4J and include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>jboEvent</code> with the action <code>previousSet</code> defined</li>
  <li><code>jboEventVo</code> with the name of the view object usage the DataScroller 
    defines</li>
  <li><code>amId</code> with the name of the application module JSP page uses 
    for the scope of the session</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>jboEventVo</code> and the <code>amid</code> parameters are required 
  by BC4J JSP pages to define a context for data access. Although your browser 
  doesn't display a link for the DataScroller web bean, the web bean works the 
  same way by passing <code>jboEvent</code> with the action <code>gotoSet</code>.</p>
<p>To understand further how the DataScroller component tag functions, you may 
  want to view the <code>DataScrollerComponent.jsp</code> definition file in JDeveloper 
  and search for the <code>&lt;jbo:UrlEvent&gt;</code> tag available in the BC4J 
  Data Tag library.</p>
<h3>Try this if your form lets you edit individual rows:</h3>
<p>If your form lets you delete and edit individual rows, mouse over the <strong>Edit</strong> 
  link and view the link definition in your browser. In this case, the DataTable 
  component tag passes the same request parameters on the URL to the target JSP 
  as the DataScroller component tag, with the addition of the <code>jboRowKey</code> 
  parameter set to the unique BC4J view object row identifier known as the rowkey. 
  Unlike the DataScroller component, the DataTable component defines a target 
  page that you can use to edit the row data (see <a href="#editform">Edit Form 
  Usage</a>).</p>
<p>To understand further how the DataTable component tag functions, you may want 
  to view the <code>DataEditComponent.jsp</code> definition file in JDeveloper 
  and search for the <code>&lt;jbo:Row&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;jbo:RowsetIterate&gt;</code>, 
  and <code>&lt;jbo:AttributeIterate&gt;</code> tags available in the BC4J Data 
  Tag library.</p>
<h2><a name="editform"></a>Edit Form Usage</h2>
<p>Use this form to edit individual rows on the view object usage. The edit form 
  uses the DataEdit component tag from the BC4J Data Tags custom tag library to 
  display the attributes of the row. The edit form identifies the specific row 
  to edit from the jboRowKey request parameter passed to it by the calling browse 
  form. The DataEdit component displays the attributes of the row using an input 
  render appropriate for the data type displayed. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In your BC4J project, you can predefine specific input 
  renders to display in your JSP page for any given view object attribute. This 
  feature, known as BC4J Control Hints, lets you define many aspects of the JSP 
  page display, including labels and tooltips, in addition to choosing controls, 
  such as the Date Picker, to render the data.</p>
<p>To understand further how the DataEdit component tag functions, you may want 
  to view the <code>DataEditComponent.jsp</code> definition file in JDeveloper 
  and search for the <code>&lt;jbo:OnEvent&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;jbo:Row&gt;</code> 
  tags available in the BC4J Data Tag library.</p>
<p><strong>To submit the row data with your changes</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter values in the view attribute's input fields.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Update</strong> to specify a new view criteria that is automatically 
    OR'ed to any preceding view criteria.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Search</strong> in the query form to display the results.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To reset the data before submitting the changes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click <strong>Reset</strong> in the edit form to reset the attribute values 
    to their original values</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="queryform"></a>Query Form Usage</h2>
<p>Use this form to define a query to a data source represented by a view object 
  usage. The query form displays text input fields, which correlate with the view 
  object's attributes. The form has its action sent to a corresponding submit 
  page. The submit page performs the following functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Processes the incoming HTML parameters</li>
  <li>Sets the Where clause based on the parameter values</li>
  <li>Executes a query and renders all the rows which correspond to the Where clause</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To execute the query</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter values in the view criteria field for the attributes they want to 
    match. The entered value must include the appropriate comparison symbol (&gt;, 
    &lt;, =). All values in the same view criteria or AND'ed together.</li>
  <li>Optionally, click <strong>Add Criteria</strong> 
    to specify a new view criteria that is automatically OR'ed to any preceding 
    view criteria.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Search</strong> in the query form to display the results.</li>
</ol>
  
<p><strong>To clear the query before beginning a new one</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click <strong>Clear All </strong> in the query form to reset the search criteria values.</li>
</ul>
